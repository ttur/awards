						<h2>Redefining the future of airport experience with biometrics_</h2>
						<p>
							Biometrics is changing how we interact with intelligent systems. It’s already used in a number of high security contexts, such as banking and passport control. In many cases the solutions are a burden and a source of stress for both employees and customers: they are perceived as threatening job security and the customer experience is lacking. But the truth is that biometrics can greatly enhance customer experiences across checkpoints, while improving security and operational efficiency. Instead of replacing employees, augmenting an employee’s strengths with a computer’s – such as pattern-based prediction and classification – results in better decisions.
						</p>
						<p>
							To gain insight into the benefits and risks from the perspective of customers , employees and technology,  Finnair - together with Finnish airport operator Finavia and digital consultancy Futurice - tested the use of face recognition technology at Helsinki Airport and at Slush2017.

								<h2>Improving on an industry standard_</h2>
								<p>
										The industry standard for recognition process at the airport is stop &amp; scan approach using separate kiosks. Customers first need to stop at the enrollment kiosks to register then at the face recognition gate to verify their image against the enrollment image. This approach not only adds additional step to customer journey for enrollment but also mimics the existing boarding pass readers at the gate, failing to  reduce the time needed to identify the customer. Futurice developed an enrollment application that allows passengers to register themselves at their own convenience. For the identification, Futurice developed an invisible walk paced identification experience, that eliminates the need for presenting a document and reduces the time spent on identification significantly.
								</p>
								<p>
									A dedicated face recognition desk equipped with a camera was provided for Finnair customers who had enrolled in the trial. They were identified as they moved towards the desk and their boarding pass was printed by the customer service agent.
								</p>
								<p>
										The trial at the airport provided useful data on the use of solutions like this in environments with large customer flows and tight security needs. The success of Futurice’s unique approach have set the trend in the aviation industry for biometrics. Product houses started focus on Mobile ID and walk-paced identification, effectively leaving stop &amp; scan approach for enrollment and identification.

							<h2>Efficiency, convenience and accessibility_</h2>
							<p>
									After validating that the chosen face recognition method saves time and improves convenience at the airport, we tested another touchpoint in the customer journey with Finnair at their stand at Slush 2017, with personalization as the main value proposition. Due to privacy concerns,  we used face feature -based face recognition technology, which turns facial images into untraceable biometrics IDs. This allowed us to identify registered customers on the go without having to store the images.
							</p>
							<p class="quote-in-text">
									“Slush, with its demanding audience of early adopters and frequent flyers, was an ideal venue for showcasing personalized services.”
							</p>
							<p>
									The demo at Slush took visitors on an imaginary trip. The setup emulated the post-security check experience at an airport when customers seek information relevant to their flight at information screens. Visitors to the Finnair stand at Slush enrolled using the same application utilized in testing the proof-of-concept at the airport. They interacted with a pillar that was equipped with face recognition capability. Once they were recognized, customers were presented with information relevant to their imaginary trip - within milliseconds. The demo explored the role face recognition can play in easing the pain points in air travel, such as access to the right information at the right time.

								<h2>The customer journey is key</h2>
								<p>
										Members of the project team visited aviation exhibitions and conferences to benchmark state-of-the-art technologies and customer experience. Other industry initiatives were carefully researched. It was obvious that the heavy focus on technology crippled the customer experience. This was an opportunity. Providing a “hands in the pocket” travel experience to customers   as a part of a seamless journey became the guiding vision for the project. In the spirit of Lean Service Creation, the vision was split into smaller chunks and the proof-of-concept at the check-in was chosen as the first step. The trial was designed to maximize generated insights in a short timeframe and at a low cost, without disrupting operations in a zero-risk environment. We kept the risk to a minimum by not integrating with any legacy systems and using events like Slush to validate the value proposition with the public.
								</p>
								<h3>
										The best UI is no UI.
								</h3>
								<p>
									Strong KPIs were defined for both the proof-of-concept trial at the airport and the service showcase at Slush. During proof-of-concept we validated the usability of the service in terms of convenience and desirability as well as the privacy concerns associated deploying a biometric solution. At Slush, customers were given a glimpse of the future of biometrics at airports. This time the focus was on personalization of the customer journey and the curation of real-time information relevant to the customer’s imaginary trip, challenging the current customer experience where customers    are required to go through an ocean of information to find what they need at any given time.

							<h2>Encouraging results</h2>
							<p>
									Between the PoC &amp; Slush, approximately 1000 people tested the biometric travelling experience. The false alarm rate was less than 5%, which outperforms the accuracy rate of manmade recognition by a margin. The trial at Helsinki Airport proved that face recognition can be used to create user-friendly biometric solutions that enhance the travel experience, even in a high people-flow space with tight security requirements. Feedback from customers showed that users are ready to embrace these services and privacy concerns are not a major obstacle.
							</p>
							<p>
									During Slush, visitors validated the the value proposition and were excited about the prospect of encountering the technology as a part of their customer experience at the airport. The most common questions were along the lines of, “Is this already in use at the airport?" and "When is it going to be available?". Some people thought they could check-in to their upcoming flight after Slush.
							</p>
							<p>
									The face recognition system also used emotion recognition as a medium for submitting feedback. More than %80 of the passengers were happy or positively surprised by the concept.
